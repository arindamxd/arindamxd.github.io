          <p><strong>Last updated: August 28, 2025</strong></p>

          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the CameraX app, developed and maintained by an application developer
            based in Bengaluru, India ("I", "me", or "the developer"), handles your data. CameraX is a personal
            project and is <b>entirely separate from my professional engagements as a developer working with other
              esteemed companies</b>.</p>

          <h2>Data Collection</h2>
